## IN DEVELOPMENT

## This is single page website that displays Table of Companies

The table contains data like: Id, Name, City, Total Income, Average Income, Last Month Income
The table is not pre-styled component.

Framework I've used is React JS. My app is function based components with hooks. 
I'm fetching data from two endoints: .../companies and .../incomes/:id

I also used:
- Lodash
- semantic ui

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
